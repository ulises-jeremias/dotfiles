    # Unified Animation System
    # ============================================================================
    # Standardized timing for consistent UX across all components
    # Duration format: <name>, <on>, <off>, <curve>, <style>
    # - on: frames to animate in (1 frame ≈ 16.67ms at 60fps)
    # - off: frames to wait before next animation
    # Standard durations:
    # - Fast: 4 frames (67ms) - Quick feedback, UI elements
    # - Normal: 6 frames (100ms) - Standard transitions
    # - Slow: 8 frames (133ms) - Major state changes

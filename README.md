## :octocat: ‎ <sup><sub><samp>HI THERE! THANKS FOR DROPPING BY!</samp></sub></sup>

You might be here looking for (Linux) rice reference or to (full?) replicate my personal
configuration of my favorite Window Managers and several apps as well. ⛄

These configuration is not only suitable for Desktop Environments but also suitable for use in [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles), [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-dotfiles), [VS Code Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_personalizing-with-dotfile-repositories), or even Linux distributions that are not Arch Linux.

This dotfiles are backed by [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) which is a dotfiles manager that is designed to be flexible and extensible. It is easy to bootstrap new machines and keep multiple machines in sync. It supports any platform that is supported by Go!

Most of my dotfiles where written from scratch, but I also took inspiration from other dotfiles repositories. The highlights about my dotfiles are the following:

- **Window Manager** 🍱 [i3](https://i3wm.org) and/or [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) and/or [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/)!
- **Panel** 🌸 [Polybar](https://polybar.github.io/) whic is a fast and easy-to-use status bar!
- **Application Launcher** 🚀 [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) which is blazing fast!
- **Desktop Notification** 🌿 [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) which is minimalist!
- **Terminal Emulator** 🌿 [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) which is GPU accelerated!
- **Shell** 🐚 [Zsh](https://zsh.org) with several post-installation tweaks!
- **Compositor** 🍧 [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) for that perfection topping!
- **File Manager** 🃏 [Thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) with a customized side pane!
- and many more!

</details>

Managed with [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io), a great dotfiles manager.

## Getting started 🚀

You can use a [convenient script](./scripts/install_dotfiles.sh) to install the dotfiles on any machine with a single command. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulises-jeremias/dotfiles/master/scripts/install_dotfiles.sh)"
```

> 💡 We use `wget` here because it comes preinstalled with most Linux distributions. But you can also use `curl`:
>
> ```bash
> sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulises-jeremias/dotfiles/master/scripts/install_dotfiles.sh)"
> ```

This will install the dotfiles in `~/.dotfiles`.

<details>
<summary>🌟 Other ways to install the dotfiles</summary>

### Using Chezmoi

> This is a recommended way to install the dotfiles generator. It will install the latest stable version of the dotfiles generator using [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) which is a dotfiles manager that is designed to be flexible and extensible.

```sh
chezmoi init --apply ulises-jeremias --source ~/.dotfiles
```

This will install the dotfiles in `~/.dotfiles`.

### From source

> Use this for any OS that is not `Arch Linux` or `Arch Linux based distro`.
> This will install unstable versions of the dotfiles generator. You can switch to a stable version by using any existing git tag.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install
```

The installation script allows you to install all the necessary dependencies to make your dotfiles config work correctly.

### From the Arch-Linux User Repository (AUR)

- Using a helper like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)

  Install [dots-stable](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dots-stable/)

  ```sh
  yay dots-stable
  ```

  or install the rolling release [dots-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dots-git/)

  ```sh
  yay dots-git
  ```

- Using `makepkg`

  Install [dots-stable](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dots-stable/)

  ```sh
  git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/dots-stable.git /tmp/dots-stable
  cd /tmp/dots-stable
  makepkg -si
  ```

  or install the rolling release [dots-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dots-git/)

  ```sh
  git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/dots-git.git /tmp/dots-git
  cd /tmp/dots-git
  makepkg -si
  ```

## 🧪 Testing

We use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to test the installation of the dotfiles generator in different
Operating Systems and machine architectures.

<details>
<summary>Expand to learn how to run a testing environment!</summary>

To run the testing environment, just execute the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/dotfiles /tmp/dotfiles
cd /tmp/dotfiles

# start the VM
./bin/play

# provision the VM
./bin/play --provision

# remove the VM
./bin/play --remove

# use -h to know more about the available options
```

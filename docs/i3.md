The `i3-wm` configuration is located at `~/.config/i3`. This file contains the actual configuration for `i3-wm`, and you have complete freedom to customize it according to your preferences.

To edit the `i3-wm` configuration, you need to run the following command:

```sh
chezmoi edit ~/.config/i3 --source ~/.dotfiles
```

Remember to apply your changes using `chezmoi apply` and restart `i3-wm` for the modifications to take effect.

To understand the different options available for customization, you can refer to the [i3 User Guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html), which provides detailed documentation on various aspects of the i3 window manager.

## Autostart Applications

In the dotfiles installation, we have included a list of applications that are automatically started when the i3 session begins. You can find this list in the `~/.config/i3/autostart.sh` file. Feel free to modify this file to add or remove applications based on your requirements.

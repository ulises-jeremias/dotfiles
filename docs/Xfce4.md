XFCE4 is a versatile and lightweight desktop environment that comes with a set of default configurations. In the dotfiles installation, XFCE4 configurations are located at `~/.config/xfce4`. These configurations are backed by XFCE4 components, which means that any customization you apply to XFCE4 will be applied globally to all the installed dotfiles.

Remember to run `chezmoi apply` after making any changes to the configuration files to ensure that the customizations are applied.

## Global Configurations

The installed dotfiles are backed by some XFCE4 components, which means that any customization you apply to XFCE4 will be applied globally to all the installed dotfiles. This allows you to have consistent configurations across different window managers.

# Date Module

The Date module displays the current date and time. It provides two variations:

- `[module/date]`: This module shows the current date and time without any additional functionality.

- `[module/date-popup]`: This module also displays the current date and time but utilizes a popup to show a calendar when clicked.

## Configuration

Feel free to customize the appearance and behavior of the Date module by modifying its configuration options. Refer to the [Polybar documentation](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Module:-internal/date) for more information on available configuration options.

## Functionality

The Date module displays the current date and time based on the specified format. It updates in real-time to reflect the current date and time.

If you are using the `[module/date-popup]` variation, you can left-click on the module to open the XFCE4 calendar. This provides a convenient way to access and view the calendar directly from the Polybar panel.

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies, such as XFCE4 calendar, installed and configured properly to use the Date module effectively.

Feel free to customize the Date module to suit your preferences and enhance your desktop experience with up-to-date date and time information.

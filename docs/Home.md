You might be here looking for (Linux) rice reference or to fully replicate my personal
configuration of my favorite Window Managers and several apps as well. ❄️

This dotfiles are backed by [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) which is a dotfiles manager that is designed to be flexible and extensible. It is easy to bootstrap new machines and keep multiple machines in sync. It supports any platform that is supported by Go!

Most of my dotfiles where written from scratch, but I also took inspiration from other dotfiles repositories. The highlights about my dotfiles are the following:

- **Window Manager** 🍱 [i3](https://i3wm.org) and/or [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) and/or [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/)!
- **Panel** 🌸 [Polybar](https://polybar.github.io/)!
- **Application Launcher** 🚀 [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) which is blazing fast!
- **Desktop Notification** 🌿 [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) which is minimalist!
- **Terminal Emulator** 🌿 [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) which is GPU accelerated!
- **Shell** 🐚 [Zsh](https://zsh.org) with several post-installation tweaks!
- **Compositor** 🍧 [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) for that perfection topping!
- **File Manager** 🃏 [Thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) with a customized side pane!
- and many more!

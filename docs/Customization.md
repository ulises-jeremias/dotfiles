# Customizing Dotfiles

You don't need to fork this repository to customize it. You can easily customize the dotfiles by leveraging the generated dotfiles directory. We encourage you to maintain a separate GitHub repository for your own dotfiles configurations.

We use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage the dotfiles. Chezmoi is a sophisticated yet easy-to-use command-line tool that helps you manage your dotfiles across multiple machines. It is designed to be secure, flexible, and easy to use.

To customize the dotfiles, follow these steps:

1. Clone the dotfiles repository to your local machine.

2. Run the command `chezmoi init` to initialize Chezmoi.

3. Run the command `chezmoi edit-config` to open the dotfiles directory.

4. Customize the dotfiles to suit your preferences and workflow.

5. Run the command `chezmoi apply` to apply the changes.

## Examples

Here are some examples of customizations made using the dotfiles:

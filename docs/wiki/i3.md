# 🧱 i3 Window Manager Guide

i3 is a **tiling window manager** built to provide an efficient and highly customizable user experience. It allows you to manage your windows using simple keyboard shortcuts and scripting tools.

> [!TIP]
> The i3 setup in this dotfiles project is fully configurable. You can personalize layouts, autostart programs, keybindings, and integrations with other tools like Polybar, Rofi, or EWW.

---

## 📁 Configuration Files Location

All i3-related configurations live in:

```sh
~/.config/i3
```

To edit using chezmoi:

```sh
chezmoi edit ~/.config/i3 --source ~/.dotfiles
```

Apply changes:

```sh
chezmoi apply
```

After editing, restart i3 (`Mod+Shift+r`) to reload the configuration.

## 🚀 Autostart Applications

Autostart programs are defined in:

```sh
~/.config/i3/autostart.sh
```

This script runs when the i3 session starts. You can add anything here:

```sh
picom --experimental-backends &
feh --bg-scale ~/wallpapers/mywall.jpg &
```

Make sure the script is executable:

```sh
chmod +x ~/.config/i3/autostart.sh
```

## ⌨️ i3 Keybindings

We’ve predefined a set of intuitive keybindings in your `i3/config` file to help you get productive fast. You can modify or extend them as needed.

## 🧠 Customization Tips

- Mix i3 with **Polybar**, **Rofi**, **EWW**, or **Picom** for a complete and modern setup
- Use workspace-specific rules and gaps for better layout control
- Define window-specific behavior (e.g., floating, no border)

> 🧪 Experiment with changes in a testing environment before applying them to your main config

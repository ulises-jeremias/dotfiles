# 🧪 Dotfiles Testing Environment Guide

Whether you're looking to contribute to the Dotfiles project or simply want to preview how everything looks before applying it to your system — we've got you covered with dedicated **testing environments**.

> [!TIP]
> The testing setup allows you to experiment safely without affecting your real configuration. It’s a perfect playground for customizing themes, scripts, and behaviors.

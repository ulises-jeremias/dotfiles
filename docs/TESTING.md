# Testing

To run the development environment you just have to run the following commands in the repository root;

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/dotfiles /tmp/dotfiles
$ cd /tmp/dotfiles
$ ./bin/test --os=<OS> --wms=<WMS> # use -h to know more about install options
```

being `OS = arch-linux | debian` and `WMS = i3,openbox,...`.

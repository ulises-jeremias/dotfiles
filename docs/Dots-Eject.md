We encourage you to use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) as a tool to keep your dotfiles always updated and maintain a consistent configuration across your systems. However, we understand that there may be situations where you want to have your own independent distribution of dotfiles.

To eject from Chezmoi and create your own dotfiles distribution, you can follow the steps documented in the guide [Migrate away from chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/advanced/migrate-away-from-chezmoi/).

If you're interested in contributing to the Dotfiles project or simply want to preview the setup before installing it on your own system, we have developed test environments that allow you to see how the changes will look and behave.

To learn more about setting up and using these test environments, please refer to the [Testing Docs](https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/dotfiles#testing) on the project's GitHub repository. The Testing Docs provide detailed instructions on how to get started with the test environments and explore the different configurations and features.

By utilizing the test environments, you can gain a better understanding of how Dotfiles works, experiment with different settings, and ensure a smooth experience before applying the changes to your own system.

We encourage you to take advantage of these test environments to make your contributions or explore the project. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with Dotfiles and ensure a seamless integration with your workflow.

Happy testing!

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your system
- Basic familiarity with shell scripting (for code contributions)
- A Linux system for testing (preferably Arch Linux)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/dotfiles
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (required for contributors):

   We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to maintain code quality. Install it with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) (recommended):

   ```bash
   # Install pipx if not already installed
   # Arch Linux:
   sudo pacman -S python-pipx

   # Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt install pipx && pipx ensurepath

   # macOS:
   brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath

   # Install pre-commit
   pipx install pre-commit

   # Set up git hooks in the repository
   pre-commit install

   # Test it works
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

   **What pre-commit does:**
   - ‚úÖ Validates shell scripts with ShellCheck
   - ‚úÖ Formats shell scripts with shfmt
   - ‚úÖ Lints Markdown files
   - ‚úÖ Validates YAML syntax
   - ‚úÖ Checks for security issues (private keys, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ Validates custom dots scripts
   - ‚úÖ Prevents direct commits to main branch

6. **Test in the playground** (recommended):
   ```bash
   ./bin/play
   ```

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

### Before Submitting

- **Search existing issues** - Your bug might already be reported
- **Try the latest version** - The issue might already be fixed
- **Test in playground** - Verify it's reproducible in a clean environment

### Creating a Good Bug Report

Use our [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and include:

1. **Clear title** - Briefly describe the issue
2. **Environment details** - OS, window manager, versions
3. **Steps to reproduce** - What did you do?
4. **Expected behavior** - What should happen?
5. **Actual behavior** - What actually happened?
6. **Screenshots** - Visual evidence helps immensely
7. **Error messages** - Include relevant logs

**Example:**

> **Title:** Polybar weather module shows wrong temperature
>
> **Environment:** Arch Linux, i3wm, Polybar 3.6.3
>
> **Steps:**
> 1. Apply gruvbox-anime rice
> 2. Check weather module on polybar
> 3. Compare with actual weather
>
> **Expected:** Should show current temperature (72¬∞F)
> **Actual:** Shows 32¬∞F (last cached value)
>
> **Logs:** `~/.cache/dots/weather.log` shows API timeout

## üí° Suggesting Features

### Before Submitting

- **Check existing suggestions** - Someone might have had the same idea
- **Consider the scope** - Does it fit HorneroConfig's philosophy?
- **Think about impact** - How would this benefit users?

### Creating a Feature Request

Use our [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and include:

1. **Clear title** - What's the feature?
2. **Problem statement** - What need does this address?
3. **Proposed solution** - How should it work?
4. **Alternatives** - What other approaches did you consider?
5. **Additional context** - Screenshots, mockups, examples

**Example:**

> **Title:** Add support for Wayland compositors
>
> **Problem:** HorneroConfig currently only supports X11 window managers
>
> **Solution:** Add configuration profiles for Sway and Hyprland
>
> **Alternatives:**
> - Create a separate project for Wayland
> - Provide documentation for manual Wayland setup
>
> **Context:** Many users are moving to Wayland for better security and performance

## üîß Contributing Code

### The Contribution Process

1. **Discuss first** for significant changes
   - Open an issue to propose your idea
   - Get feedback from maintainers
   - Agree on implementation approach

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Test thoroughly in the playground

4. **Commit with meaningful messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add spotify integration to music player module"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Link related issues
   - Add screenshots for visual changes

### Code Style Guidelines

**For detailed technical guidelines:**
- Quick reference: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- Comprehensive guides: [docs/](docs/)
  - [Development Standards](docs/Development-Standards.md) - Script templates and standards
  - [Architecture Philosophy](docs/Architecture-Philosophy.md) - Design principles
  - [Integration Patterns](docs/Integration-Patterns.md) - Best practices
  - [Security Guidelines](docs/Security-Guidelines.md) - Security requirements
  - [Performance Guidelines](docs/Performance-Guidelines.md) - Optimization tips

Here are the key principles:

- **Follow existing patterns** - Look at similar code for examples
- **Keep it simple** - Readable code is better than clever code
- **Write comments** - Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- **Test your changes** - Use the playground environment
- **Check with shellcheck** - Lint your shell scripts
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't leave users confused

### Commit Message Format

We follow conventional commits for clarity:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: add weather forecast to polybar module
fix: correct color contrast in light themes
docs: update installation guide for Ubuntu
refactor: simplify smart colors caching logic
```

## üé® Creating Rice Themes

Want to share your beautiful desktop theme? Here's how:

### Rice Theme Structure

Create a new directory in `home/dot_local/share/dots/rices/`:

```
your-rice-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.sh          # Theme configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apply.sh           # Application script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backgrounds/       # Wallpaper images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preview.png        # Theme preview (required)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Theme description (optional)
```

### What to Include

**config.sh** - Theme settings:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Rice metadata
RICE_NAME="your-rice-name"
RICE_DESCRIPTION="Brief description of your theme"

# Polybar configuration
POLYBAR_PROFILE="default"  # or "minimal"

# GTK theme
GTK_THEME="Orchis-Dark-Compact"
ICON_THEME="Papirus-Dark"

# Optional: Window manager specific settings
I3_GAPS_INNER=10
I3_GAPS_OUTER=5
```

**apply.sh** - Setup script:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Load rice configuration
RICE_DIR="$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")"
source "${RICE_DIR}/config.sh"

# Your customization logic here
# Set wallpaper, apply colors, configure apps, etc.
```

**backgrounds/** - At least one high-quality wallpaper

**preview.png** - Screenshot showcasing your theme (recommended: 1920x1080)

### Submitting Your Rice

1. Create your rice theme directory
2. Test it thoroughly:
   ```bash
   dots rice apply your-rice-name
   ```
3. Take beautiful screenshots
4. Submit a PR with:
   - Your rice files
   - Preview screenshot
   - Description of the theme's aesthetic

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### Using the Playground

The playground provides a safe testing environment:

```bash
# Start default environment
./bin/play

# Test with specific window manager
./bin/play --provision i3
./bin/play --provision openbox

# Clean up when done
./bin/play --remove
```

### What to Test

**For all changes:**
- Does it work as intended?
- Does it handle errors gracefully?
- Does it work in both light and dark themes?
- Does it work with different window managers?

**For visual changes:**
- Does it look good in all rice themes?
- Are colors appropriate and readable?
- Does it scale properly on different resolutions?
- Does it work on multiple monitors?

**For scripts:**
- Does it handle missing dependencies?
- Does it clean up after itself?
- Does it log appropriately?
- Does shellcheck pass?
